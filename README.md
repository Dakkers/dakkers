My recent experience:

- I spearheaded the development of [ApplyBoard](https://applyboard.com/)'s design system Crystal UI
- I did quite a bit of full-stack work at Bidvine (now defunct)

I also:

- Work on the website [Learn Oneida](http://learn-oneida.com/)
- Compose [orchestral music](https://dakota-stlaurent.bandcamp.com/) and [music suitable for video games](https://saintlyaudio.bandcamp.com/)
- Care for [potbelly pigs](https://www.instagram.com/pigs_of_scotland)
